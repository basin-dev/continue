- need to create migration file
- create a database table
- add model for ORM
- very tedious
- have one easily generate
- Frameworks automate with boilerplate
- Make you fill in things
- People will edit migration but forget model file
- Format you need to follow
- Canâ€™t solve the business logic
- Create a migration file that adds a column
- tested with chatgpt
- able to generate an interface / object
- Right now using TypeScript, using TypeORM, using NestJS backend framework

0. Slash command for TypeORM migration with some natural language input about the migration (required value?)
1. Check if the connection in `ormconfig.json` has been set up. If not, ask user to do it with instructions on how to do it
2. Once it is, automatically fill in the new / adjusted entity (based on info provided) and wait for approval from developer
3. Execute CLI command to create a new migration
4. Look for migration response
5. Add up / down methods to add / revert changes in the migration and ask for review from developer
6. Make sure output of migrations looks good

Side effects on the database??
Too structured already??
