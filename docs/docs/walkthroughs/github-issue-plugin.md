# GitHub Issue Plugin

1. User says in natural language: "Create a GitHub Issue out of this bug" (highlighting relevant code)
2. Action runs that select the file involved, my env details, etc. to create a summary
4. Asks for any additional things to know for issue
3. Should be able to add more files at this point
4. Open an issue with all of that on GitHub repo

Other thoughts
- How does auth setup work?
- Should be able to work no matter where you are in context of other policies?
- Maybe we need commands for APIs / other tools / apps?
- How would natural language be used to direct what policy should be used?
- Mirror plugin: import this info in and set things up for you
