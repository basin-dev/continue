# Agents

An agent is an AI endowed with a series of resources to act on, and a set of hooks that define when it will take such actions.

An agent includes
- history
- llm
- filesystem
- activate status
- policy

What are agents?
- Probably not the right word
- Central meeting point of everything
- Both user and LLM as model
- Common word that others are using
- The thing that takes the action
- Agents instantiate with a LLM, a property of the agent
