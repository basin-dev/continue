# Core

The `Core` connects the SDK and GUI with the IDE (i.e. in VS Code, a web browser, etc), enabling the steps to make changes to your code and accelerate your software development workflows.

The `Core` includes
- IDE protocol
- GUI protocol
- SDK
- Agent

There is a two-way sync between an IDE and the GUI that happens through Core.

**Q: does this make sense as a concept?**
