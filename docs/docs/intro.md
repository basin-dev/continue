# Introduction

## Scripts reimagined in the age of LLMs

### Automate more steps of your software development workflows using LLMs

#### An open-source framework to accelerate your use of LLMs while coding

1. Leverage steps created by others in your workflows as you code.
2. Customize steps and compose them together to fit your workflows.
3. Review, reverse, and rerun steps to use LLMs with confidence.

## How Continue works

The Continue framework consists of a `SDK`, a `GUI`, and a `Core` that brings everything together.

The `SDK` gives you access to tools (e.g. open a directory, edit a file, call an LLM, etc), which you can use when defining how a step should work and composing them with other steps.

The `GUI` enables you to guide steps and makes everything transparent, so you can review all steps that were automated, giving you the opportunity to undo and rerun any that ran incorrectly.

The `Core` connects the SDK and GUI with the IDE (i.e. in VS Code, a web browser, etc), enabling the steps to make changes to your code and accelerate your software development workflows.
