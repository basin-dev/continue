**Agents** are an ordered set of **actions** and **validators**, which are extended by a **router**

**Sequences** are an ordered set of **steps** and **events**, which are extended by a **generator**

**Workflows** are an ordered set of **tasks** and **events**, which are extended by a **generator**
