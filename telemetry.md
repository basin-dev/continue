# Telemetry

## How it works

- We use Segment to record telemetry about user actions
- We record client-side and server-side events
- This data is sent to a Google BigQuery data warehouse
- On free version of Segment, data is only updated daily
- You can query this data using the Trevor.io tool

## What we track

### Event

we record the VS Code machine ID, time of the event, and the type of event as
well as some additional properties for some of the events.

- Collect the files that were edited
- Collect the code at a later time to see what it ultimately ended up
- Collect when a debugging session starts
- Collect when a debugging session ends
- Add an ID for bugs based on debugging window (plus, new stack trace)
