# Root Python Package

This is the root package of all Python code for Continue (except that which lives in `extension/scripts` in order to be run client-side).

> Note: Usually, when you want to run a file on its own you should go to the root `continue` folder, then do `python -m package.<module>.<filename>` (as fits with the filepath you want). This runs the file as module so it can make relative imports.
