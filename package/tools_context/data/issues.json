You might be able to decide based off of cursor position, change the cursor type depending on hover, etc... but should fall back to just a basic yes/no quickentry after a bit\n\nAlso, I'm assuming Copilot uses decorations to show tab completions, or else it has access to some custom API. But you could do something like that which is keyboard controlled.\n\n- pointer cursor -> hover provider -> get info about where user is hovering -> tell them to click to accept -> keyboard shortcuts, like arrow up/down do select between ranges\n\t\u25cf\tIf you cmd+enter on a quick action, there is a refactor preview. This could be good for stuff\n\t\u25cf\tcmd+enter to accept, cmd+shift+enter to reject, cmd+j/k for up/down, escape to clear suggestions (reject all), jump to next suggestion after one is cleared, maybe can control cursor so only up/down is needed. Or get j/k going.
